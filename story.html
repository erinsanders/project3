    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <p>New York with an accent. Latin American inspired. Local by heart.
    	A stylish, rustic-chic and charming eatery, Comodo is about a personal love story with a region and its flavors but keeping it true to the environment where it is found. This food is what happens when you take a Colombian-Spanish-Mexican-Brazilian-American that has adapted to New York. The decor of the 45 seat restaurant will convey the feeling of dining at home.</p>
