      <h2>The Latin American Dinner Party Brought to Life in New York City</h2>
      <p>October 4, 2013</p>
      <p>Dark Rye, the Whole Foods publications did an incredible piece on us. The art of the dinner party lived through our parents, throughout Latin America and now we bring that to our nights at Comodo.</p>

      <h2>The Magic of a Dinner Party Lives On</h2>
      <p>October 24, 2012</p>
      <p>People often wonder what exactly it is that I do at our freshly new Comodo restaurant. Many ask me if I cook, if I help with the cooking, if Felipe and I cook together. The answer is a simple no. In fact, if you want to know the truth, I can barely use the oven (and when I say barely, I mean I have never once used an oven). What I am really drawn to, in a big way, is the magic that happens when people get together for food and the invisible molecules that float around the air of a dinner party. This draw goes all the way back to when I was a child. Growing up in Mexico City, I believe this is true to all Latin America, it’s normal and routine to go to sleep with dinner noise. On a Monday, Tuesday or any given day of the week, a last kid’s thoughts and sounds before falling into profound sleep are that of their parents, their friends, their special music, conversations and laughter. As a child I also developed a strong connection to the anticipation of a dinner, which is just as strong of an emotion as the party itself. The experience would begin with me in my mom’s room, watching her get ready and dressing up for the big event because no matter how routine a dinner party could become, you always get ready, it is always special and you always prepare for it with care.</p>

      <p>So here I am now, and no matter what Felipe and I call our project (dinners at home, supper club, pop up dinner parties, restaurant) it seems like I always land in the same place, craving that dinner party experience. At Comodo, every night is beautifully different and we prepare for it with care. The anticipation begins to build as soon as we wake up and start prepping for it, wondering what will happen at night, who will be there, what will be talked about. And when a champagne bottle is popped and receives a clap from the entire dining room, during those instances when we hear a wave of laughter across the room, or when one table gets up to greet and hug another table I think maybe we have done it, maybe we have transferred the dinner party into a restaurant. And when those nights happen, Felipe and I close the restaurant with satisfaction in our hearts and with many anecdotes and stories about people and the magic that happens when food is around. And it is during those late nights when we say to each other, let it be loud and let girls wear out their best dress. Let it be different and let it feel special, let our friends greet Felipe at the kitchen and let our guests greet people at the door. If it has followed us around this far, let the night win and let the magic of a dinner party take over.</p>

      <h2>The Thing About Uncertainty</h2>
      <p>October 24, 2012</p>
      <p>The deeper we go in, the more I realize the beauty (and the curse), the fascinating and the pulse raising thing about owning a restaurant is all the uncertainty that floats around. There is no way of knowing you’ve made it, or that you’ve gotten there”. There’s no way of knowing if you’ll be around, if you’ll be popular in a month, if the buzz will keep on. Each day you shoot high and hope for the best and you wake up wanting better. Uncertainty makes you shiver and then aggressively pushes you forward.</p>

      <p>Owning a restaurant requires sprinting while running a marathon. It’s about putting all your energy into one night and making it magical, fantastic, memorable. 5pm rolls around and you begin pouring it all out, the dark takes over and you surrender to it and its flow, its mistakes and its gifts, you leave it all out there on the floor. The next morning you wake up with soreness of the body, the heart and of the mind. Still, there’s this force that helps you fight through it. You get up and you do it all over again. And I have to believe that force is uncertainty. In the right light, uncertainty is that very thing that pushes you, keeps you present, makes you feel alive, the one thing that opens you up to it all (for the good and for the bad). Not knowing where you’ll be tomorrow hurries you to get there.</p>

      <p>As we keep on keeping on, maybe we’ll beat it or maybe it will get the best of us, but I believe if we are open to it, if we let it, uncertainty might be the one thing that gets us to where we want to go and best of all, it’s the thing that will keep us humble all the way through.</p>
