      <h2>The Latin American Dinner Party
      <br>Brought to Life in New York City</h2>

      <p>October 4, 2013</p> </div>
      <p>Dark Rye, the Whole Foods publications did an incredible piece on us.
      <br>The art of the dinner party lived through our parents, throughout 
      <br>Latin America and now we bring that to our nights at Comodo.</p>

      <p>JANUARY 10, 2013</p> </div>
      <p>We are going back to our roots and how it all began. Comodo was born
      <br>out of a dinner party, a spirit and a passion that continues every
      <br>night at 58 MacDougal Street.</p>

      <p>To share this spirit, we have created: #comodoroots: Dinner Parties popping
      <br>up in studios, beaches, fields, and living rooms across the country.</p>

      <p>To debut the roots we will travel south of the mason dixon line, and to
      <br>Tamy & Felipe’s origins of Mexico and Colombia, serving dinner in each
      <br>city along the way. Follow #comodoroots for tales of these clandestine
      <br>yet very familiar gatherings.</p>

      <h2>The Magic of a Dinner Party Lives On</h2>
      <div class="date">
        <p>OCTOBER 24, 2012</p> </div>
        <p>People often wonder what exactly it is that I do at our freshly new Comodo restaurant. 
        <br>Many ask me if I cook, if I help with the cooking, if Felipe and I cook together.
        <br>The answer is a simple no. In fact, if you want to know the truth, I can barely use the 
        <br>oven (and when I say barely, I mean I have never once used an oven). What I am really 
        <br>drawn to, in a big way, is the magic that happens when people get together for food and
        <br>the invisible molecules that float around the air of a dinner party. This draw goes all 
        <br>the way back to when I was a child. Growing up in Mexico City, I believe this is true to
        <br>all Latin America, it's normal and routine to go to sleep with dinner noise. On a Monday,
        <br>Tuesday or any given day of the week, a last kid's thoughts and sounds before falling into
        <br>profound sleep are that of their parents, their friends, their special music, conversations
        <br>and laughter. As a child I also developed a strong connection to the anticipation of a dinner,
        <br>which is just as strong of an emotion as the party itself. The experience would begin with me 
        <br>in my mom’s room, watching her get ready and dressing up for the big event because no matter 
        <br>how routine a dinner party could become, you always get ready, it is always special and you 
        <br>always prepare for it with care.</p>

      <p>So here I am now, and no matter what Felipe and I call our project (dinners at home, supper club,
      <br>pop up dinner parties, restaurant) it seems like I always land in the same place, craving that 
      <br>dinner party experience. At Comodo, every night is beautifully different and we prepare for it
      <br>with care. The anticipation begins to build as soon as we wake up and start prepping for it,
      <br>wondering what will happen at night, who will be there, what will be talked about. And when a
      <br>champagne bottle is popped and receives a clap from the entire dining room, during those instances
      <br>when we hear a wave of laughter across the room, or when one table gets up to greet and hug another
      <br>table I think maybe we have done it, maybe we have transferred the dinner party into a restaurant.
      <br>And when those nights happen, Felipe and I close the restaurant with satisfaction in our hearts and
      <br>with many anecdotes and stories about people and the magic that happens when food is around. And it
      <br>is during those late nights when we say to each other, let it be loud and let girls wear out their
      <br>best dress. Let it be different and let it feel special, let our friends greet Felipe at the kitchen
      <br>and let our guests greet people at the door. If it has followed us around this far, let the night
      <br>win and let the magic of a dinner party take over.</p>

      <h2>The Thing About Uncertainty</h2>
      <div class="date">
        <p>OCTOBER 24, 2012</p> </div>
      <p>The deeper we go in, the more I realize the beauty (and the curse), the fascinating and the pulse
      <br>raising thing about owning a restaurant is all the uncertainty that floats around. There is no
      <br>way of knowing you've made it, or that you've gotten there. There's no way of knowing if you'll
      <br>be around, if you'll be popular in a month, if the buzz will keep on. Each day you shoot high
      <br>and hope for the best and you wake up wanting better. Uncertainty makes you shiver and then
      <br>aggressively pushes you forward.</p>

      <p>Owning a restaurant requires sprinting while running a marathon. It's about putting all your energy
      <br>into one night and making it magical, fantastic, memorable. 5pm rolls around and you begin pouring it
      <br>all out, the dark takes over and you surrender to it and its flow, its mistakes and its gifts, you leave
      <br>it all out there on the floor. The next morning you wake up with soreness of the body, the heart and
      <br>of the mind. Still, there’s this force that helps you fight through it. You get up and you do it all
      <br>over again. And I have to believe that force is uncertainty. In the right light, uncertainty is that
      <br>very thing that pushes you, keeps you present, makes you feel alive, the one thing that opens you up
      <br>to it all (for the good and for the bad). Not knowing where you'll be tomorrow hurries you to get there.</p>

      <p>As we keep on keeping on, maybe we'll beat it or maybe it will get the best of us, but I believe if
      <br>we are open to it, if we let it, uncertainty might be the one thing that gets us to where we want
      <br>to go and best of all, it's the thing that will keep us humble all the way through.</p>
